    {abstract, "ejabberd is a high-performance instant messaging server. "
    "An instant messaging server allows to transfer presence and status information "
    "between users connected to serverse and support real-time communications between them.<br>"
    "ejabberd relies on XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) a largely-accepted XML "
    "protocol standardized by the IETF (The Internet Engineering Task Force). "
    "The protocol evolution is handled by the Jabber Software Foundation (JSF), "
    "whose mission is to create the world's best protocols for instant messaging, presence, "
    "and other forms of near-real-time communication based on XML."}.
